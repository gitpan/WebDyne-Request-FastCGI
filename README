WebDyne::Request::FastCGI is part of the WebDyne suite of modules. It
provides a FastCGI responder wrapper so WebDyne will work with FastCGI
servers such as Lighttpd.

It should also work with other FastCGI servers such as Litespeed and Zeus,
and works with the Windows IIS FastCGI module.

WebDyne::Request::FastCGI will only work within WebDyne and will not
function as a stand-alone module.
