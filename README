WebDyne::Request::FastCGI is part of the WebDyne module. It provides a
FastCGI wrapper so WebDyne will work with FastCGI servers such as Lighttpd. 
It should also work with other FastCGI servers such as Zeus, and works with
the Windows IIS FastCGI module.

WebDyne::Request::FastCGI will only work within WebDyne and will not
function as a stand-alone module.
